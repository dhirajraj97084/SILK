          Being based in Goa it is a bit surprising that I actually do not get to cover a destination wedding in Goa all that often. However, the ones I do get to attend usually turn out to be quite fantastic. So was the case with Vivek and Sarah’s wedding at the Park Hyatt. It was actually two weddings, a Christian white wedding on the first day, followed by the Hindu wedding a couple of days later. Two or one wedding, it was one big party over the three days at the great Park Hyatt in south Goa. (If you are there do try Chef Saulo’s Tiramisu…)

          It did not take long to understand I was in the right place. Sarah wanted me to take a picture of the bridesmaids dresses hanging in the other room but I thought it would probably make a better picture if the girls actually hide behind the dresses wearing their birthday suits. They all agreed and there was no ice to break after that. The party was on.

          Sarah was looking spectacular in her white dress in the Goa afternoon sun. It was a lovely ceremony. Possibly one of the best I have attended. Maybe a bit too short to photograph, but we managed somehow.  “Could you now say I now pronounce you man & wife” she asked the priest as the five minute ceremony way over. “We don’t say this here in Goa” he said, to which she replied; “Maybe, but this is MY wedding!”. He did pronounce them ‘man and wife’ of course.
