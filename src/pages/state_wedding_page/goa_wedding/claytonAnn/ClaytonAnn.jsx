        If you are planing a church wedding in Goa there are quite a few places to hold the ceremony. There is a small chapel at the top of a hill which remains locked most of the time. Nevertheless, it is worth coming up here for a spectacular view of the Salcette countryside in general and the town of Margao in particular. The road leads up to Monte Hill and the Chapel of Calcada de Nossa Senhora de Piedade, which is popularly known as Our Lady of Mercy. Clayton and Ann chose this little quaint chapel on top of the hip for their wedding in Goa but they traveled far to come here. The groom is originally from Goa but now lives in Bahrain and the couple met through their work contacts. He brought her all the way from Switzerland.

        WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY IN GOA

          When you think of an Indian wedding in Goa you would usually think of a destination wedding on Cavalossim beach or one of the other beaches of south Goa but this was not a beach wedding. A christian wedding in Goa is probably the closest any Indian wedding can get to being a church white wedding. I guess it is quite similar to a church wedding anywhere else in the world. I have had a few chances to cover Catholic weddings in Goa in the past and they are quite charming. An interesting mix of cultures of Indian and Portuguese traditions. Clayton and Ann’s was true to this promise. It was indeed charming. I loved those intimate moments at the church when Clay put his head on Ann’s shoulder. And the priest; Father Valmiki Dias was most definitely the coolest guy around. We had to take a picture of the couple with him when he finally came to the Leela, all dressed in black and a super hip Jesus army barrette on his head.

          The reception, or the party to be more precise, was at the gorgeous grounds of The Leela Goa property on Cavelossim beach. We managed to jump in the car right after the wedding and sprint down to the beach for a quick bare-foot fun couple shoot
