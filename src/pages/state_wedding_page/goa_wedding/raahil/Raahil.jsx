        DESTINATION WEDDING AT PARK HYATT GOA
          </h1>
          <p className="text-center md:text-start pb-6">
          The season is back in Goa and the weather is great again. Time for the first destination wedding of the season, and this one is one of those weddings that one posts is not enough to cover. Planning a destination wedding in Goa could go both ways. You might opt for a simple beach party, or take it up a notch (or two) by working with a wedding design company. I have seen quite my share of weddings in Goa, but I must admit that the decor and execution by the Crosscraft team exceeded all I have known about weddings in Goa till now. From the beautiful rustic forest decor of the Mehendi area, to a complete over-the-top set-up on the beach for the engagement, and the indoor club for the after party; the first day had set a high standard. It was such a colourful and beautiful experience that for minute I was not sure it was really in Goa.

          However, the scale of the wedding, and the beauty of the decor, where only the backdrop for one of the craziest, happiest, nicest weddings we have ever covered. The Bhatia and Kapoor families came from Delhi with the intention to have a PARTY, and bot did they have a blast.

          Raahil and Pia have known each other for years, and the number of mutual friend they had, topped by the ever-so-ready-to-party Punjabi nature, turned this beautiful love marriage into a festival. From the decor, to the food, the music and the sea breeze, this was a wedding we will remember. Surely the Barat, which was the longest and craziest I have ever seen!

          <p className="text-center md:text-start pb-6">
          Here are a few pictures of the first day; the Champaign lunch at the forest, the Teeka and engagement on the beach, and the after party. The next post will have the pictures of the wedding day, starting with the â€˜Alohaâ€™ Haldi lunch at the â€˜Dunesâ€™, the Barat that took over two hours (!), and the finale of the wedding on the beach.

          A big congratulations to Raahil and Pia for this lovely memory, and of course for being happily married! ðŸ™‚ Thank you for having us with you as a part of your wedding. It was a great pleasure working with you and both families.
