        <p className='pb-4'>We are living in a digital age. My wife watches her favourite TV shows on her iPhone, and my daughters communicate with their teachers on Zoom. I still remember the days of using film, but honestly, most photographers today shoot digitally. It is a digital world, but I still feel that some pictures deserve to be printed and framed.</p>

        <p>You are likely to receive at least a few hundred photographs from your wedding, and it is indeed difficult to know how to proceed once you have these digital files. Most couples are happy with the digital files, and the fact that they are easy to store and share. Never the less, if you know and understand the value of keeping printed memories and the value of having a physical object beyond a digital copy, youâ€™d want to consider investing in fine art prints as a family legacy.</p>
