          <p className='text-center md:text-start pb-6'>I usually write for photographers but this post might actually be slightly different in the sense that it is meant more for the person on the other side of the line who is looking to hire the services of a professional photographer. As in everything else this is a two sided thing and as photographers you should also know how to value your work and what you bring to the table.</p>

           <h1 className='text-xl md:text-2xl py-5'>A CREATIVE TALENT IS NOT A VENDOR</h1>
           <p className='text-center md:text-start py-3'>Not like in the editorial or the advertising world where a photo editor usually has more experience of working with different photographers and creative talents, a wedding client is likely to be looking for a professional photographer for the first time in her/his life. You are looking to purchase services from an artist and it is a mistake to confuse him with a vendor. It is a very easy mistake to make. In the day to day life you are used to buying services from the telephone company, your insurance guy, your local store. Maybe you work in the service industry, an investment banker, a travel agency. However, a photographer is not a vendor. He has a talent, a magic that a vendor does not possess. A vendor is there to sell something and many times it doesn’t really matter what they sell as long as there is a financial transaction at the end of the process. You can haggle, compare prices, make a bid, do what you want basically and as long as the contract is signed properly you will get what you ordered and the quality of the service or product that you purchase will not be affected by the negotiating process. The coconut water will taste the same. Not with a photographer. The quality of the work you get from a photographer changes based on how you work with him and this is the biggest difference between a vendor and a creative talent. If you treat a photographer like a vendor you are shooting yourself in the foot and are likely to get a mediocre result in return. On the other hand, if you treat a coconut vendor like an artist you’ll be wasting your time and money.</p>

           <p className='text-center md:text-start py-3'>A few days back in a land of saffron oranges and saffron project of political outfits, a marriage ceremony happened without Kanyadaan in Nagpur, Maharashtra. The mother of the groom took a stand and edited the Kanyadaan out from the marriage ceremony as she believed that the ritual objectifies women, and is redundant in modern times. While it is heartening to see such a positive change, such cases are rare.</p>
           <p className='text-center md:text-start py-3'>It would not be too much to say that many of these old traditions are oppressive for Indian women, and with an increasing level of education, many women want to opt out of some regressive rituals.</p>
           <h1 className='text-xl md:text-2xl py-5'>A WEDDING CEREMONY AT 3AM IN THE MORNING</h1>
           <p className='text-center md:text-start py-3'>Pallavi (33) got married seven years ago, and does not have many fond memories of her wedding ceremony. While it was meant to be the most important day of her life, she did not have much of a say in the way her own wedding took place. As the cost of the arrangement of the wedding function was borne by the bride’s family, the groom’s family behaved as guests and put lot of indirect demands on her family in the names of customs and rituals. Copious number of gifts, jewellery and cash were exchanged, which she felt was as if her love was reduced to a business transaction.</p>
           <p className='text-center md:text-start py-3'>She was asked to change her saree in wee hours during vidaai because after kanyadaan she was only supposed to wear the clothes given to her by her husband’s family. “While it was inconvenient to change clothes at such odd hours, it was very demeaning for me as a woman. Of course, I did not smile in pictures because I was too tired of these rituals being observed at midnight when I was half asleep”, she adds. Given a chance to do it all over again, Pallavi would opt for a destination wedding with close friends and family, wear a comfortable outfit with minimal jewellery. A subtle and classy wedding ritual would be closer to who she really is.</p>

           <p className='text-center md:text-start py-3'>The couple are seated on an elevated platform and all the guests are invited to bless them, give their presents and have a picture taken together with the bride and groom. This is an exhausting process that could sometime take a couple of hours. Bengali wedding, Delhi 2008</p>
           <p className='text-center md:text-start py-3'>31-year-old Bhavesh (name changed) was tired of wearing a heavy sherwaani for 7-9 hours in hot weather. He also had to manage the distant aggressive relatives who were hell-bent of pushing many of the rituals and customs to bride’s family, which eventually prolonged the wedding unnecessarily. It was an extremely tiring affair for him and the forced smiles for the camera totally drained him out.</p>

          <h1 className='text-xl md:text-2xl py-5'>THE FACT  IS THAT VENDORS ARE EASIER TO REPLACE THAN ARTISTS</h1>
           <p className='text-center md:text-start py-3'>Vendors could spend the day in office cubicles under fluorescent lights and wait for that call to come and an order to be placed. They will be happy to fill out the forms and spend time negotiating the terms and conditions. They could stand all day in the sun on the streets of India and sell the same chai every day without a difference in quality. They could be indifferent about what they sell as the focus here is volume and continuity. While a photographer is also paid to take pictures he is not a vendor and is not motivated in the same way. The fact  is that vendors are easier to replace that artists.</p>
            <h1 className='text-xl md:text-2xl py-5'>CAPTURING THE PERFECT MOMENT IS THE MAGIC</h1>
           <p className='text-center md:text-start py-3'>Getting the perfect moment, or creating the perfect picture, takes more than owning a new camera and having a website with pictures. Even if your wedding planner created the most beautiful setup and all the elements are there, it is still up to the photographer to make his magic. The next guy will be selling the same coconut but another photographer will not take the same pictures. The industry, every industry, is built on relationship and many vendors expect, and sometimes value, an impersonal nature of relationship. The flower vendor really does not care and many times not interested in who buys the flowers. The same goes for the catering and all other service providers, but not with a photographer or an artist. Yes, of course you should treat vendors with respect. All human beings deserve respect and will do their best work if treated fairly, but when you want someone to dig deep and bring something out that is beyond the number of pictures that you get at the end of the day, you’re going to have to respond in kind.</p>
